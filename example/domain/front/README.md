TODO
- Refactor code into two vuex modules, that this project can easily be used as a template
- Is it possible to set ip of Address that were not registered by me?
- Use pathify instead of pure vuex
- set Magic on http PUT verb
- style notfound component
- Refresh user balance after transfer and withdrawal
- BUG: Enter-key in form makes dropdown open, instead
- add paging for lists
- On first start: show message if environment varialble ENDPOINT is correctly set (maybe console.log) 

BUG
- mainnet-wallet doesn't show dapp-withdraw transactions (e.g. sending XAS from dapp -> mainnet)
